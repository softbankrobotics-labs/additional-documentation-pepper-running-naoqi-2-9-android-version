Navigation using the QiSDK

Navigation tutorial for Pepper running on Android.

The **User Guide** of this application is available [here](User_Guide-Best_Practices_for_Navigation.md).

This version is compatible with Pepper running **Naoqi OS 2.9.5.172** and more.

**It is strongly recommended to use a Pepper 1.8 hardware version to perform navigation**.

Required configuration:
* **Software**: NAOqi version 2.9.5.172 (Market Release) 
* **Hardware**: **Pepper 1.8** hardware version (four wholes above the neck). Even if most of the code will work on **Pepper 1.8a**, the performances are not good enough for a **Production Environment**.
* **Charging Station**: If you have a **Charging Station**, it is required to install the application **Autonomous Recharge** on your robot to use it. It is available on [Command Center Store](https://command-center.softbankrobotics.com/store/).

**Note** : A lot of debug logs are published by this application on purpose, to help you understand the **steps** and **status**.

## Navigation using the qisdk

All customers are longing to see Pepper move around their premises. Here is an overview of everything the [QiSDK](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-qisdk/api/motion) provides today for creating a successful navigation experience with the robot.

Creating a navigation use case needs to be done in 2 steps: Setup-time, when the robot learns its environment in order to get a usable map, and Production-time, when the robot navigates using this map. Those 2 steps can be done in the same app or in two different apps, but the goal is to have to do the setup once only, and then only run production.

### Setup time

During setup, you need to teach your robot the map of the room(s) it will have to navigate in, as well as all the points of interest in this room. This is done manually, pushing the robot around the room to show it the path it is able to drive through. The goal is to create an [ExplorationMap](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-qisdk/api/motion/reference/explorationmap) object.

#### 1) Mapping the environment

As of API level 7, there is no possibility to provide a blueprint of your premises to Pepper so it can locate itself in it. The navigation engine only supports maps that are created by Pepper, in the same API version. This step should be executed when the place is empty, otherwise people or others will be recorded in the map as obstacles.

##### 1.1) Define and learn the right "base starting point" named MapFrame

The MapFrame is where you plan to start the app everyday. This position will be learnt very precisely by Pepper and will represent the "zero", the origin of your map. The robot will be able to relocate very precisely at this position, hence getting a good initial position to start navigating in the morning! 

Make sure the charging Flap is **closed**, make sure there is no one around the robot (they would be recognized as permanent obstacles) for at least 15s. Then start [LocalizeAndMap](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-qisdk/api/motion/reference/localizeandmap). This will make the robot look around, effectively taking 360째 pictures that will be used to recognize its location and orientation later on.
<pre><code class="java">
// Build the action.
LocalizeAndMap localizeAndMap = LocalizeAndMapBuilder.with(qiContext).build();

// Run the action asynchronously.
Future<Void> localizingAndMapping = localizeAndMap.async().run();
</code></pre>

##### 1.2) Show the robot around

Once the mapping of the origin of the map (MapFrame) is finished, open the **Charging Flap**. Place yourself **behind** the robot and slowly push it around the premises. 

###### 1.8a robots
During this step, the robot uses its cameras, odometry and its laser sensors to map its close environment. If you don't stay behind the robot(don't walk on the side of Pepper), it will see you as an obstacle and block this way in the final map. Move slowly so Pepper has the time to record more information from the lasers. For better result, try not to make loops but rather straight paths or radial movements.
During this step, the robot will also learn the paths to navigate through the map. Pepper will always prefer the path you used during this mapping phase when moving. 
Last, if you know some places are key positions where the robot may need to relocalize, then stop and make a 360째 at that place, so the robot takes pictures all around and not only in front.

###### 1.8 robots (better performances)
During this step, the robot uses its stereo cameras. They work as two smartphones cameras but in grayscale (no color). It does Visual SLAM, constant relocalization with image comparison and odometry to map its environment.
A visual landmark detection is performed, we try to match contrasted corners. So ideally hold the tracking so the head stays in the front of the robot. Pictures are not saved, only mathematical data associated to it.

1. Try to maximize the amount of texture in the environment:
* Good :  posters, paintings, plants, random stuff
* Bad : empty white wall

2. You should try to avoid blur during LocalizeAndMap and minimize it during Localize actions. In order to do that:
* For lighting conditions we recommend 300lux minimum and 500lux or more as nice too have criteria.
* Try to have a moving speed of the robot of 0.3m.s-0.8m.s during LocalizeAndMap (or less).

3. Avoid obstructions of the cameras during LocalizeAndMap. Try avoiding people standing in front of the robot during LocalizeAndMap. If you push the robot, push it from the back.

4. Make the robot move (pushing or joystick) along the desired navigation path (route) during the Localize and map. It will help localizing during production mode as the robot sees the same pictures then.
* Keep head angles at 0 degrees (pitch and yaw) during the LocalizeAndMap. It helps seeing the same pictures in production mode (better than looking at the floor or the ceiling).
* During localizeAndMap, make the robot move as if it was a car and the tablet is the front of the car. It helps taking pictures in front of the robot (then the robot will navigate this way).

5. Try to come back exactly at the starting position(MapFrame) then do a 360째 turn, stopping every 30째, before finishing (requestCancellation()) the LocalizeAndMap. It helps improving the consistency of the map.

**It is now possible to make loops in your app.** And this is even Better (Pepper 1.8 hardware version).

Also ideally hold the tracking so the head stays in the front of the robot, and move slowly so the pictures are of good quality and Pepper can record more of them.

**When doing the map, it is necessary to go along the robot path in both directions to able the robot to take pictures of its environnement in both directions. Then, when it will navigate, it will be able to localize itself in both directions.
Always go back to the MapFrame when you are done mapping before stopping the LocalizeAndMap action and saving the map.**

##### 1.3) Save the map


Congratulations, Pepper knows your premises! You can now stop mapping and save the map: 
<pre><code class="java">
// Stop the action.
localizingAndMapping.requestCancellation();

// After having moved the robot around, dump the current description of the explored environment.
ExplorationMap explorationMap = localizeAndMap.dumpMap();

// Serialize the ExplorationMap data.
StreamableBuffer mapData = explorationMap.serializeAsStreamableBuffer()

// write the StreamableBuffer into a file
/* You can find how in the SaveFileHelper class */
</code></pre>

Note : In this application, the map and the POI are saved in folder "sdcard/Maps"
The android permission WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE needs to be granted by the user first.

#### 2) Learn the Points of Interest

In this map, we now need to teach Pepper some specific locations it will later need to go to. They are named "Points of Interest". In our cas, we will only use [Localize](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-qisdk/api/motion/reference/localize) which does not modify the map anymore, so it is safe to pass through Pepper's lasers.

##### 2.1) Localize the robot

Let's reset the location of the robot. For this, place the robot close to the MapFrame (where you started the [LocalizeAndMap](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-qisdk/api/motion/reference/localizeandmap) earlier). Then launch a [Localize](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-qisdk/api/motion/reference/localize).

<pre><code class="java">
// Build the action.
Localize localize = LocalizeBuilder.with(qiContext)
                                   .withMap(explorationMap)
                                   .build();
// Run the action asynchronously.
localize.async().run();
</code></pre>

The robot will look around to find its right location in the maps you built earlier. Once this is done, the [LocalizationStatus](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-qisdk/apidoc/javadoc/qisdk/com.aldebaran.qi.sdk.object.actuation/-localization-status/index.html) will be LOCALIZED. To make sure you get notified when the robot is ready you can use the code:

<pre><code class="java">
// Add a listener to get the map when localized.
localize.addOnStatusChangedListener(localizationStatus -> {
    if (localizationStatus == LocalizationStatus.LOCALIZED) {
        /* robot is ready! */
    }
});
</code></pre>


##### 2.2) Take the robot to the points of interests

Open the **Charging Flap** and push the robot to the different position you want to teach. Using its odometry, cameras, lasers and previously learnt map, the robot will know where it is compared to the origin of the map(MapFrame), at all time. Once you get to those position, name and record them (into a TreeMap or a hashmap for instance) using the code below.
<pre><code class="java">
public TreeMap<String, AttachedFrame> savedLocations = new TreeMap<>();

public Future<Void> saveLocation(final String location) {
    // Get the robot frame asynchronously.
    Log.d(TAG, "saveLocation: Start saving this location");
    return createAttachedFrameFromCurrentPosition()
            .andThenConsume(attachedFrame -> savedLocations.put(location, attachedFrame));
}

public Future<AttachedFrame> createAttachedFrameFromCurrentPosition() {
    // Get the robot frame asynchronously.
    return actuation.async()
        .robotFrame()
        .andThenApply(robotFrame -> {
            Frame mapFrame = getMapFrame();

            // Transform between the current robot location (robotFrame) and the mapFrame
            TransformTime transformTime = robotFrame.computeTransform(mapFrame);

            // Create an AttachedFrame representing the current robot frame relatively to the MapFrame
            return mapFrame.makeAttachedFrame(transformTime.getTransform());
        });
}

</code></pre>

**Charging Station Frame**: In MapLocalizeAndMove application, the position of the Charging Station is saved as any other point of interest. During the saving step of the points of interest, if there is no Charging Station frame saved yet, the application will ask the user to push Pepper on its station, then click "Save". When doing a "GoTo Charging Station" or "GoTo Charge" in the app, the goToChargingStation function, located in the GoToHelper, will create a new **Frame** by applying a transform of 0.75 meter and 180째 to the saved Charging Station Frame, to make Pepper move just in front of the station. Then the app will start the Autonomous Recharge application to make Pepper dock on its station.

##### 2.3) Save the points of interest

When you have recorded all the [Frames](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-qisdk/api/motion/reference/frame) you need, save the list in a file that you can reopen later. Note that it is not possible to serialize a Frame directly, but rather the translation between two frames (your frame and the mapFrame in our case). So you need to extract the translation component of the [Transform](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-qisdk/api/motion/reference/transform-transformtime), and record the two coordinates and the orientation (X, Y, Theta) instead.

For simplicity, a class to regroup the two coordinates X / Y and the orientation Theta is available :
<pre><code class="java">
public class Vector2theta implements Parcelable, Serializable {
    private double x, y, theta;

    private Vector2theta(double x, double y, double theta) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.theta = theta;
    }

    /**
     * creates a Vector2theta representing the translation between two frames and angle
     * @param frameOrigin the origin of the translation
     * @param frameDestination the end of the translation
     * @return the Vector2theta to go from frameOrigin to frameDestination
     */
    public static Vector2theta betweenFrames(@NonNull Frame frameDestination, @NonNull Frame frameOrigin) {
        // Compute the transform to go from "frameOrigin" to "frameDestination"
        Transform transform = frameOrigin.async().computeTransform(frameDestination).getValue().getTransform();

        // Extract translation from the transform
        Vector3 translation = transform.getTranslation();
        // Extract quaternion from the transform
        Quaternion quaternion = transform.getRotation();

        // Extract the 2 coordinates from the translation and orientation angle from quaternion
        return new Vector2theta(translation.getX(), translation.getY(), NavUtils.getYawFromQuaternion(quaternion));
    }

    /**
     * Returns a transform representing the translation described by this Vector2theta
     * @return the transform
     */
    public Transform createTransform() {
        // this.theta is the radian angle to appy taht was serialized
        return TransformBuilder.create().from2DTransform(this.x, this.y, this.theta);
    }
    /***************** Add here automatic Parcelable implementaion (hidden for readability) *******************/
}
</code></pre>

To backup the location, we will first transform savedLocation into a TreeMap containing serializable objects (Vector2Theta). Then we can write this new TreeMap directly into a file using OutputStream.

<pre><code class="java">
public void backupLocations() {

            TreeMap<String, Vector2theta> locationsToBackup = new TreeMap<>();
            Frame mapFrame = robotHelper.getMapFrame();

            for (Map.Entry<String, AttachedFrame> entry : savedLocations.entrySet()) {
                // get location of the frame
                AttachedFrame destination = entry.getValue();
                Frame frame = destination.async().frame().getValue();

                // create a serializable vector2theta
                Vector2theta vector = Vector2theta.betweenFrames(mapFrame, frame);

                // add to backup list
                locationsToBackup.put(entry.getKey(), vector);
            }

}
</code></pre>

Write a function  "locationsToBackup" into a file, using "ObjectOutputStream" for example.

<pre><code class="java">
public void saveLocationsToFile(String filesDirectoryPath, String locationsFileName, TreeMap<String, Vector2theta> locationsToBackup) {

    Gson gson=new Gson();
    String points =gson.toJson(locationsToBackup);

    FileOutputStream fos = null;
    ObjectOutputStream oos = null;

    // Backup list into a file
    try {
        File fileDirectory = new File(filesDirectoryPath, "");
        if (!fileDirectory.exists())
        {
            fileDirectory.mkdirs();
        }
        File file = new File(fileDirectory, locationsFileName);
        fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
        oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);
        oos.writeObject(points);
        Log.d(TAG, "backupLocations: Done");
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
        Log.d(TAG, e.getMessage(), e);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        Log.d(TAG, e.getMessage(), e);
    } finally {
        try {
            if (oos != null) {
                oos.close();
            }
            if (fos != null) {
                fos.close();
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            Log.d(TAG, e.getMessage(), e);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>



### Production

#### 1) Load the map and find the current location

##### 1.1) Place the robot at its MapFrame (base location)

First, with the **Charging Flap** open, move the robot to a position close to the base position you defined [earlier](https://partner-portal.aldebaran.com/projects/knowledge-base/wiki/Navigation_using_the_qisdk#1-Mapping-the-environment). Using [Localize](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-qisdk/api/motion/reference/localize) the robot will use its lasers and its cameras to look around for known features in its environment. It is theoretically able to locate itself anywhere (Only with 1.8 robot since API 6)  within the [ExplorationMap](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-qisdk/api/motion/reference/explorationmap) you created during setup, but for consistent performances we recommend that you start close to the base location(MapFrame).

##### 1.2) Let the robot locate itself

Close the **Charging Flap**, load the map you created earlier and run a Localize :

<pre><code class="java">
// Get an exploration map.
ExplorationMap explorationMap = ...;

// Build the action.
Localize localize = LocalizeBuilder.with(qiContext)
                                   .withMap(explorationMap)
                                   .build();
// Run the action asynchronously.
localize.async().run();
</code></pre>

+Note:+ If you need, the robot can also readjust automatically and go to its precise base location with a simple [GoTo](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-qisdk/api/motion/reference/goto) action:
<pre><code class="java">
// Add a listener to get the map when localized.
localize.addOnStatusChangedListener(localizationStatus -> {
    if (localizationStatus == LocalizationStatus.LOCALIZED) {
        // Retrieve the map frame and go to it.
        movement = qiContext.getMapping().async().mapFrame()
                .andThenCompose(mapFrame -> GoToBuilder.with(qiContext).withFrame(mapFrame).buildAsync())
                .andThenCompose(goTo -> goTo.async().run())
                .thenConsume(future -> {
                    if (future.isSuccess()) {
                        Log.d(TAG, "Map frame reached successfully");
                    } else if (future.hasError()) {
                        Log.d(TAG, "Error while going to map frame", future.getError());
                    }
                });
    }
});
</code></pre>

#### 2) Move around

##### 2.1) Reload known locations

First, load and deserialize the list of PoI into the map of Frames. This uses the same Vector2Theta as defined earlier. 
<pre><code class="java">
private void loadLocations() {

        return FutureUtils.futureOf((f) -> {
            // Read file into a temporary hashmap
            File file = new File(getFilesDir(), "points.json");
            if (file.exists()) {
                // Read file into a temporary hashmap, for example using "ObjectInputStream"
                Map<String, Vector2theta> vectors = saveFileHelper.getLocationsFromFile(filesDirectoryPath, locationsFileName);

                // Clear current savedLocations
                savedLocations = new HashMap<>();
                Frame mapFrame = robotHelper.getMapFrame();

                // Build frames from the vectors
                for (Map.Entry<String, Vector2theta> entry : vectors.entrySet()) {
                    // Create a transform from the vector2theta
                    Transform t = entry.getValue().createTransform();
                    Log.d(TAG, "loadLocations: " + entry.getKey());

                    // Create an AttachedFrame representing the current robot frame relatively to the MapFrame
                    AttachedFrame attachedFrame = mapFrame.async().makeAttachedFrame(t).getValue();

                    // Store the FreeFrame.
                    savedLocations.put(entry.getKey(), attachedFrame);
                    load_location_success.set(true);
                }

                Log.d(TAG, "loadLocations: Done");
                if (load_location_success.get()) return Future.of(true);
                else throw new Exception("Empty file");
            } else {
                throw new Exception("No file");
            }
        });
    }
}
</code></pre>

##### 2.2) Navigate

Whenever you need the robot to go somewhere, you need to get the **Frame** from the **AttachedFrame** then, just use the **Frame** to build and run a **GoTo** action.
<pre><code class="java">
// Store the GoTo action.
private GoTo goTo;

void goToLocation(final String location) {
    // Get the FreeFrame from the saved locations.
    FreeFrame freeFrame = savedLocations.get(location);

    // Extract the Frame asynchronously.
    Future<Frame> frameFuture = freeFrame.async().frame();
    frameFuture.andThenCompose(frame -> {
        // Create a GoTo action.
        goTo = GoToBuilder.with(qiContext)
                .withFrame(frame)
                .build();

        // Display text when the GoTo action starts.
        goTo.addOnStartedListener(() -> Log.i(TAG, "Moving..."));

        // Execute the GoTo action asynchronously.
        return goTo.async().run();
    }).thenConsume(future -> {
        if (future.isSuccess()) {
            Log.i(TAG, "Location reached: " + location);
        } else if (future.hasError()) {
            Log.d(TAG, "Go to location error", future.getError());
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

**Note**: If you need the robot to go back to its base location, you can provide the [mapFrame](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-qisdk/api/motion/reference/frame#map-frame) to a **GoTo** action:
<pre><code class="java">
void goHome() {
    Mapping mapping = qiContext.getMapping();
    Frame mapFrame = mapping.mapFrame();
    GoTo goTo = GoToBuilder.with(qiContext).withFrame(mapFrame).build();
    // Display text when the GoTo action starts.
    goTo.addOnStartedListener(() -> Log.i(TAG, "Moving..."));
    goTo.async().run().thenConsume(future -> {
        if (future.isSuccess()) {
            Log.i(TAG, "Location reached: Home");
        } else if (future.hasError()) {
            Log.e(TAG, "Go Home error", future.getError());
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

#### 3) Autonomous Recharge - Charging Station

The application Autonomous Recharge is now available on [Command Center](https://command-center.softbankrobotics.com/store/) and the User Guide is available on the [Support Pages](https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/support/pepper-naoqi-2-9/2-daily-use#title-3).

A library is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aldebaran/qisdk-sample-autonomous-recharge-advanced-integration) to ease the use of Autonomous Recharge from your own application.

The [README](https://github.com/aldebaran/qisdk-sample-autonomous-recharge-advanced-integration/blob/master/README.md) explains how to use it and how it works.
If you are using Navigation along the use of Autonomous Recharge, you have to make Pepper move in front of the Charging Station and set recallPod to **false** before starting the docking with :
<pre>
AutonomousRecharge.startDockingActivity(this, recallPod)
</pre>
